LOADING COLECOVISION ROM FILES
------------

If you want to load rom image in your emulator, you
have to put your rom file (with .zip, or .rom file
extension) on your Dingux SD card in the 'rom'
directory.

Then, while inside DinguxColem emulator, just press
Start to enter in the emulator main menu, and then
using the file selector choose one rom file to load
in your emulator. Back to the emulator window, the
rom should stard automatically.

You can use the virtual keyboard in the file
requester menu to choose the first letter of the
game you search (it might be useful when you have
tons of games in the same folder). Entering several
time the same letter let you choose sequentially
files beginning with the given letter. You can use
the Run key of the virtual keyboard to launch the
rom.

You may use the Trigger key to swap between the two
virtual keyboard panels (numbers & letters)

LOADING KEY MAPPING FILES
----------------

For given games, the default keyboard mapping
between Dingux Keys and ColecoVision keys, is not
suitable, and the game can't be played on Colem.

To overcome the issue, you can write your own
mapping file. Using notepad for example you can edit
a file with the .kbd extension and put it in the kbd
directory.

For the exact syntax of those mapping files, have a
look on sample files already presents in the kbd
directory (default.kbd etc ...).

After writting such keyboard mapping file, you can
load them using the main menu inside the emulator.

If the keyboard filename is the same as the rom
filename (.zip etc ...) then when you load this rom,
the corresponding keyboard file is automatically 
loaded !

You can now use the Keyboard menu and edit, load and
save your keyboard mapping files inside the
emulator. The Save option save the .kbd file in the
kbd directory using the "Game Name" as filename. The
game name is displayed on the right corner in the
emulator menu.


CHEAT CODE (.CHT)
----------

You can use cheat codes with DinguxColem You can add
your own cheat codes in the cheat.txt file and then
import them in the cheat menu.  All cheat codes you
have specified for a game can be save in a CHT file
in 'cht' folder.  Those cheat codes would then be
automatically loaded when you start the game.

The CHT file format is the following :
#
# Enable, Address, Value, Comment
#
1,36f,3,Cheat comment

Using the Cheat menu you can search for modified
bytes in RAM between current time and the last time
you saved the RAM. It might be very usefull to find
"poke" address by yourself, monitoring for example
life numbers.

To find a new "poke address" you can proceed as
follow :

Let's say you're playing Zaxxon and you want to find
the memory address where "number lives" is stored.

. Start a new game in Zaxxon
. Enter in the cheat menu. 
. Choose Save Ram to save initial state of the memory. 
. Specify the number of lives you want to find in
"Scan Old Value" field.
(for Zaxxon the initial lives number is 4)
. Go back to the game and loose a life.
. Enter in the cheat menu. 
. Specify the number of lives you want to find in
"Scan New Value" field.
(for Zaxxon the lives number is now 3)
. In Add Cheat you have several matching Addresses
. Specify the Poke value you want (for example 6) 
and add six new cheats with this address / value.
. Try them one by one to identify what is the good
one, while restarting new games and see if the 
life number is 4 or 6. You will see that the good
address is 717D. You can delete all others.

The cheat is now activated in the cheat list and you
can save it using the "Save cheat" menu.

Let's enjoy Zaxxon with infinite life !!
